  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my GitHub projects repo. Here you will find some coding projects in various states of completion. Not everything is intended to be completed, but rather a portfolio of things I have tried. GameMaker is currently my main coding hobby.</p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  Current projects I have featured.
  <h3><a href="https://github.com/MayorMike/Colour-Shift-Platformer">Colour Shift</a></h3>
  <p>A platformer-puzzle game created in GameMaker. Change into one of 3 colours to solve the puzzle. Has 3 colour themes to change between. Default, Xbox Buttons pallet, and PlayStation Buttons pallet.
Use the Arrow keys to move, Space to jump and Left-Shift to cycle through colours. Use I, O or P to change to Default, Xbox or PlayStation colour pallets. </p>
<br>
This gif shows the different pallets being used.

And yes, I am spelling "Colour" correctly.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/MayorMike/rm-machines-dont-break">rm-machines-dont-break</a></h3>
A fork of a Rimworld mod that makes machines not breakdown. Odyssey DLC broke it and I can't seem to fix it. I have no idea what I am doing...
